# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project applies and compares three classification models—Decision Tree, KNN, and Naive Bayes—for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. PCA is applied to explore dimensionality reduction and its effect on model performance.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Features: V1–V28 (anonymized), Time, Amount
- Target: Class (0 = Not Fraud, 1 = Fraud)

## 🧪 Models Used
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Naive Bayes

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

## 🎯 PCA
PCA is used to reduce dimensionality while preserving 95% variance. We compare model performance before and after PCA.
